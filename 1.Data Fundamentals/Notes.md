## 1.3 Introduction To Managing Data Projects and Products

### Objectives:

- The limitations of Waterfall project management
- Embracing Agile principles
- Navigating roles and responsibilities in Agile
Scrum
- Integrating Lean and Six Sigma Principles

**1. Waterfall Model**
- Requirements
- Design
- Development
- Testng
- Deployment

**2. Waterfall Challenges:**
 - Requirements set in stone
 - Complex estimation
 - Volumes of design documentation
 - Customers or stakeholder unavailability
 - Can resist change
 - Development often takes longer than expected
 - Must wait for complete user feedback

**3. Agile Principles:**
- Interactions over processes and tool
- Iterative development
- Close collaboration
- Responding to change

**4. Benefits of Agile Engineering:**
- Faster iteration
- Effective feedback loops
- Enhanced collaboration
- Responsiveness to change
- Flexible planning

**5. Scrum**
- A lightweight and practical Agile methodology (framework)
- Whereas Waterfall often uses tooling such as MS Project,
Scrum uses tooling such as Atlassian Jira

**6. Kanban**
- In the context of data engineering, Kanban can be particularly useful for managing the complex
workflows and diverse tasks involved in the project lifecycle
- Kanban focuses on visualising work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and enhancing project visibility

**7. Sprints**
- fixed-time iterations, between 2 and 4 weeks in length
- 3-week sprints are typical
- Each sprint starts with planning and ends with retrospective
- A sprint produces a demonstration of something that works

**8. Daily Standups**
These are short daily team meetings (usually in the morning)
They are designed to:
- Discuss what you achieved the previous day
- Discuss the plans for the rest of the day
- Discuss any blockers 

**9. Scrum Master**
- Service to Others, Moderator & Delegate
- Shared: Decision-Making, Power and Responsibility
- Promotes Team Spirit and Collaboration & Protects the Team
- Agile Expert & Analytical Mind
- The role of the Scrum Master encompasses several critical functions aimed at facilitating, improving, protecting, rewarding, and educating the Scrum Team

**10. The Product Owner**

**11. Sprint Planning**
- preparation
- sprint goal definition
- task estimation
- planning poker
- voting
- consensus building
- finalisation

**12. Burndown charts**
- Track remaining work against time axis
- Help monitor progress and adherence to sprint goals
- Facilitate identification of deviations from planned
trajectory
- Enable early detection of issues and bottlenecks
- Promote transparency, accountability, and informed
decision-making

**13. Scrum boards and sprint backlog**
A Scrum board visually represents the sprint backlog with columns like "To Do," "In Progress,"
and "Done," enabling team members to track progress and address bottlenecks

**14. Backlog grooming**
- Ongoing grooming ensures top backlog items are sprint-ready
- Meetings involve product owner, team, and Scrum Master
- Team reviews stories before the meeting
- Criteria, complexity, and strategy are discussed
- Details are refined until everyone agrees
- Stories are estimated using planning poker

**15.Sprint reviews**
- A sprint review is a crucial ceremony in Agile methodology that occurs at the end of each sprint cycle
- Its primary purpose is to demonstrate completed work to stakeholders
- During sprint reviews the Scrum team showcases the product developed during the sprint

**16. Sprint retrospectives**
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- What will we commit to doing in next sprint?
- Review the Definition of Done for the whole Sprint

**17. Writing User Stories**
- User-centric
- Template
- INVEST Criteria
- Acceptance criteria
- Iterative refinement

**18. ‘Invest’ User Stories**
- I - Independent
- N - Negotiable
- V - Valuable
- E - Estimable
- S - Small
- T - Testable

**19. Definition of Done (DoD)**

**20. The Lean (Six-Sigma) framework**
- improve efficiency and productivity
- reduce waste

**21. 5 pillars  of Lean:**
- define
- measure
- analyse
- improve
- control

**22. Lean + Six Sigma = DMAIC**
- Combining the principles of Lean and Six Sigma methodologies

**23. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
- MVP is a strategy for delivering a product with the
minimum set of features to satisfy early customers and
gather feedback
- Used to quickly validate assumptions, test
hypotheses, and gather feedback
- Reduce time to market, minimise costs, and mitigate
risks

## 1.4 Introduction To Reliable Data Architecture

### Objectives:
- Model standardised big data ecosystems and architectures for
enterprise data using visual approaches
- Describe the benefits of the three-layered architecture pattern
for organisational data management
- Describe how the microservices architecture style enables
organisations to build flexible, scalable, and resilient data
products
- Define architectural governance and its role in ensuring
reliability and compliance

**1. An architecture diagram**
- Explains the abstract idea for your system
- How stakeholders will interact with it
- The constraints of the system
- Is often drawn as layers

**2. A design diagram**
- Normally does not have stakeholders, constraints or layers
- Focuses on one part of the system and shows its building
blocks

**3. UML component diagrams**

**4. System component diagrams**

**5. Tips for creating architecture diagrams**
- Version Control your diagrams – they will evolve
- Simplify when possible, split when necessary
- Create logical groupings using polygons and colours
- Complement diagrams with descriptions
- Avoid too many acronyms
- You will normally have to explain the symbols you use

**6. Integration architecture diagram**

**7. Deployment architecture diagram**

**8. Data architecture diagram**

**9. TOGAF**
- TOGAF, developed by The Open Group, stems from the
US Department of Defense's Technical Architecture
- Each version is publicly available on The Open Group's website, emphasising transparency in architectural standards development
- TOGAF breaks the ADM (Architecture Development Method) into phases, where each phase has its own:
- Inputs
- Objective
- Approach
- Steps
- Outcomes

**10. Data Mesh - Embracing data decentralisation**
