## 2.1 Storing and querying data

### Objectives
- Data storage options
- Files systems and RDBS data
- Implementing cloud storage

**1. Data storage options:**
- Filesystems - text data, binary data
- RDBMS (SQL) - local, remote
- Non-relational databases (NoSQL) - Cloud

**2. Unicode**
- UTF 8
- UTF 16
- UTF 32

**3. MIME types**
A MIME type is a label used to identify a type of data. It is used so software can
know how to handle the data. It serves the same purpose on the Internet that
file extensions do on Microsoft Windows.

**4. File encryption**

**5. From files to databases:**
- Files get messy
- A filesystem is not the most efficient structure for querying data
- Databases are a structured way of querying data

**6. Types of cloud storage:**
- Block storage
- File storage
- Object storage

**7. Data model**
- Data models are conceptual ways for describing the data
- They can use SQL, or other languages
- They can also be visual (remember diagrams)

The data model description generally consists of three parts:
- Structure of the data – what does it look like
- Operations on the data – what's available
- Constraints on the data – what's allowed

**8. Commonly used data models:**
- Relational Data Model
- Key-Value Data Model
- Semi-structured Data
- Model (e.g., Json, XML)

**9. Terminology**
- Relations/Tables
- Columns/Attributes/Fields
- Rows/Tuples/Records
- Degree (arity) of a relation = #attributes
- Cardinality of a relation = #tuples
- relation schema name of the table
- database schema the set of schemas in relations of database
- domains - data types

**10. Keys**
- Key = one (or multiple) attributes that uniquely identify a record
- Multiple-attribute Key = multiple attributes that uniquely identify a record
- Foreign keys - Attribute(s) whose value is a key of a record in some other relation

**11. SQL**
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) which allows users to create, modify and
query data
- Data Definition Language (DDL) which is used to define external and
conceptual schemas

❑ Which cloud storage solutions are used by your org?
❑ Which teams use them?
❑ What are the use cases and business requirements?
❑ How is the benefit to the business evidenced?
❑ Are there any challenges?
Additional research for extend/stretch:
❑ Who monitors the cloud solutions internally?
❑ What is the customer's satisfaction with your org’s cloud
storage offering?
